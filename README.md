# Data Mining Project 2020/2021 - PVA Customer Segmentation

As MSc Students in Data Science and Advanced Analytics at Nova Information Managment School, it was asked to us to develop a customer segmentation for the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) as final project of the Data Mining Course. Using a dataset provided by this non-profit organization, our main goal was to better understand how their donors behave and identify the different segments of donors/potential donors within their database. 

This analysis was only possible with the help of preprocessing techniques and clustering models learnt during the semester to help us adquire a better business understanding of this sector and group donors by their behaviour, getting some insights about the best approach to maximize the donation's amount and the best customer description.

Finally we explained the clusters we created and we made a detailed marketing idea for each one.

The report which accompanies the notebook can be consulted at: http://bit.ly/PVA_CostumerSegmentation.
